Program is used to create exact number of files for printing.



- I created citiesAndCapitals.py to easily write code for statesQuiz.py capitals dictionaries.

- I copied capitals and cities of Europe and Usa from we and  pasted them to editor. It was something like:
Albania Tirana
Andorra	       Andorra

Armenia	   Yerevan
Austria	Vienna

It was badly formated in clipboard, so I had to  manually add ' ' and : if I wanted this format for python:
{'Armenia': 'Yerevan', 'Andorra': 'Andorra', 'Albania': 'Tirana', 'Austria': 'Vienna'}

citiesAndCapitals script automates the boring  cities and capitals editing for dictionary.
